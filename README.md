The notebooks on this repository were used in an undergraduate course on quantum mechanics (PHY 3310) at [High Point University](https://www.highpoint.edu/physics/) during the Fall 2021 semester. 

- [Introduction to Single Spins](tutorials/01_IntroSingleSpins/01_IntroSingleSpin.ipynb)
- [Stern Gerlach Experiment](tutorials/02_SternGerlachExperiment/02_SternGerlachExperiment.ipynb)
- [Time Evolution](tutorials/03_TimeEvolution/03_TimeEvolution.ipynb)
- [Multiparticle Systems and Entanglement](tutorials/04_Entanglement/04_Entanglement.ipynb)
- [EPR Experiment and Bell's Inequality](tutorials/05_BellsInequality/05_BellsInequality.ipynb)

- [NCS-AAPT Quantum Computing Workshop](workshop/QuantumComputingNCS2022.ipynb) (see below)

More detailed exposition on various activities is documented in my blog: [Theoretically Physics](https://theoreticallyphysics.wordpress.com/)

In April 2022, I led a workshop on using IBM quantum computers to explore introductory quantum mechanics as the [North Carolina Section of the American Association of Physics Teachers](https://sites.google.com/site/ncsaapt/) (NCS-AAPT) [Spring Meeting](https://sites.google.com/site/ncsaapt/meetings/2022-spring-meeting). Several of the individual activities listed above were compiled into a [single notebook](workshop/QuantumComputingNCS2022.ipynb) with additional information. This workshop [notebook](workshop/QuantumComputingNCS2022.ipynb) might be a good starting point for a first glance, but this uses an older version of Qiskit.
