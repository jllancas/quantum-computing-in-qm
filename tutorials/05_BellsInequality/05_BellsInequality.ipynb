The observers have agreed to measure spin along one of three pre-defined axes, $\\hat{\\bf a}$, $\\hat{\\bf b}$, $\\hat{\\bf c}$. Each observer selects one of these axes at random for each measurement, and this process is repeated many times. At the end of the experiment, the observers can compare their measurements. Because the observers <i>might</i> use different axes for the measurement of a given singlet, it is possible that each obtains $+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (or $-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$) for their portion of the same singlet. The perfect anticorrelation appears somewhat smoothed out by this randomized axis choice.\n",

    "In class, we showed that one may obtain an upper bound on the probability of both observers obtaning the same value for a given measurement by assuming some hidden variable exists which fixes the outcome of the spin measurement along any of these axes.
