    "In the last activity, we introduced some basic aspects of how to use quantum computers to simulate a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ degree of freedom. Of particular importance were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An arbitrary two-level state can be created from the default initialization $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ by application of $\\hat{U}(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda)$ for suitable choices of $\\theta$, $\\phi$ with $\\lambda = 0$.\n",
    "2. The spin projection of a state can be measured in any direction $\\hat{n}(\\theta,\\phi)$ by appropriately rotating the state before performing a standard measurement of $\\hat{S}^{z}$ (i.e., the \"computational basis\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's endeavor, we will build on these ideas to construct a simulation of the famous Stern-Gerlach experiment.

This is perhaps the easiest conceptual way to approach repeated measurements. However, it's far from the most efficient approach. One could design each compound circuit from scratch to reduce the number of gates. For our purposes (and certainly with simulator results), this shouldn't matter much.
