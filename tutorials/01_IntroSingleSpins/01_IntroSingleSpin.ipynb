    "<b>Challenge Exercise: </b> The histogram is a convenient means of visualizing the probabilities. But we can also quantify a statistical uncertainty from these measurements. Such an uncertainty is based on the variance of the measurements. The effective uncertainty $\\delta S^{z}$ is given by the standard error of the mean\n",

    "where $\\sigma_{S^{z}}$ is the standard deviations in the measurements of $\\hat{S}^{z}$. Thus, you can report the result as the expectation value, plus-or-minus some effective uncertainty. Calculate the expectation values explicitly for $\\left\\langle \\hat{S}^{x}\\right\\rangle$, $\\left\\langle \\hat{S}^{x}\\right\\rangle$, $\\left\\langle \\hat{S}^{x}\\right\\rangle$ for the state $\\left|+\\right\\rangle_{y} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|+\\right\\rangle +i\\left|-\\right\\rangle\\right)$.\n",

So you might need to check for the case where only one key exists and manually add the other entry with zero counts. Something like this would work:\n",
