For $n$ sufficiently large, the approximate result should converge to the exact result. This process is sometimes referred to as <b>Trotterization</b>.\n",

The interactions of a single spin with an external magnetic field are special in that it is possible to obtain the exact time evolution operator. For multiple spins, the types of possible interactions <i>between</i> spins result in significantly more complicated Hamiltonians for which this exact analysis is not generally possible. But by decomposing (approximately) the exponential of a fairly complicated Hamiltonian into a series of simple Trotterized factors, it becomes possible to simulate much more interesting dynamics. Indeed, the anticipated value of future quantum devices is that such simulations will be much more efficient than state-of-the-art computations on classical devices.\n",
